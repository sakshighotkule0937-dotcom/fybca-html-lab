    <p> <h3> Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata "C. V." Raman (/ˈrɑːmən/ RAH-muhn;[2] Tamil: சந்திரசேகர வெங்கட ராமன், romanised: Cantiracēkara Veṅkaṭa Rāmaṉ; 7 November 1888 – 21 November 1970) was an Indian physicist[3] known for his work in the field of light scattering.
        , Raman received the Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery and was the first Asian and non-White person to receive a Nobel Prize in Physics.[5]

Born to Tamil Brahmin parents, Raman was a precocious child, completing his secondary and higher secondary education from St Aloysius' Anglo-Indian High School at the age of 11 and 13, respectively. He topped the bachelor's degree examination of the University of Madras with honours in physics from Presidency College at age 16.

  Raman's elder brother Chandrasekhara Subrahmanya Ayyar had joined the prestigious Indian government service, Indian Finance Service (now Indian Audit and Accounts Service).[24] Raman followed suit and qualified for the Indian Finance Service achieving first position in the entrance examination in February 1907.[25] He was posted in Calcutta (now Kolkata) as Assistant Accountant General in June 1907.[11]    </i>
